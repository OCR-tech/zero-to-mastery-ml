        "You can do numerical calculations using pure Python. In the beginning, you might think Python is fast but once your data gets large, you'll start to notice slow downs.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the main reasons you use NumPy is because it's fast. Behind the scenes, the code has been optimized to run using C. Which is another programming language, which can do things much faster than Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "The benefit of this being behind the scenes is you don't need to know any C to take advantage of it. You can write your numerical computations in Python using NumPy and get the added speed benefits.\n",
        "\n",
        "If your curious as to what causes this speed benefit, it's a process called vectorization. [Vectorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectorization) aims to do calculations by avoiding loops as loops can create potential bottlenecks.\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy achieves vectorization through a process called [broadcasting](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.broadcasting.html#module-numpy.doc.broadcasting)."

        "2. **Search for it** - If trying it on your own doesn't work, since someone else has probably tried to do something similar, try searching for your problem in the following places (either via a search engine or direct):\n",
        "    * [NumPy documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html) - The ground truth for everything NumPy, this resource covers all of the NumPy functionality.\n",
        "    * [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This is the developers Q&A hub, it's full of questions and answers of different problems across a wide range of software development topics and chances are, there's one related to your problem.\n",
        "    * [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - ChatGPT is very good at explaining code, however, it can make mistakes. Best to verify the code it writes first before using it. Try asking \"Can you explain the following code for me? {your code here}\" and then continue with follow up questions from there. Avoid straight copying and pasting and instead, only use things that you could yourself reproduce with adequate effort.\n",
        "    \n",
        "An example of searching for a NumPy function might be:\n",
        "\n",

        "Searching this on Google leads to the NumPy documentation for the `np.unique()` function: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.unique.html\n",
        "\n",
        "The next steps here are to read through the documentation, check the examples and see if they line up to the problem you're trying to solve.\n",
        "\n",
        "If they do, **rewrite the code** to suit your needs, run it, and see what the outcomes are.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Ask for help** - If you've been through the above 2 steps and you're still stuck, you might want to ask your question on [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com). Be as specific as possible and provide details on what you've tried.\n",

        "    2. If the shape of the two arrays does not match in any dimension, the array with shape equal to 1 in that dimension is stretched to match the other shape.\n",
